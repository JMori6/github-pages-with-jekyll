Last time, I talked about my favourite HTML and CSS tags. Today I want to talk about what I wan to do with my knowledge. I want to make a website that has hyperlinks that lead directly to the games I am going to create!
With this website, people will be able to access my games and play them. I'll probably call it GameKub (Because the last part of my name is Kub).
