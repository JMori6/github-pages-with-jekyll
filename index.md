# Welcome to my blog

I'm glad you are here. I plan to talk about how much I *love* coding with HTML/CSS. I love making webpages because I find that it's a **great** way to express yourself in a new way. You just need to learn all the different tags and how they're used and you're well on your way to making great webpages.

My favourite HTML tags are the ordered list tags (<ol>), the heading tags (<h1> - <h6>) and of course the title tag (<title>).
